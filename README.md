# Second Order Systems Matlab Application

## Application Overview

<div align="justify"> This MATLAB app provides an interactive way to analyze transfer functions, offering features to display Bode plots, step responses, and pole-zero diagrams.  A slider allows users to dynamically modify key system parameters such as natural frequency (wn), decay constant (ζ), and gain (K). This enables real-time exploration of how adjustments to these parameters affect the system's frequency response, time-domain behavior, and stability characteristics. The app serves as a valuable tool for control system engineers and students to gain insights into the relationship between transfer function parameters and overall system behavior. </div>

## Key Features 

- **Transfer Function Display:** The app displays the user-defined transfer function in a clear and formatted manner.
  
- **Bode Plot:** <div align="justify"> It generates a Bode plot, a graphical representation of the transfer function's magnitude and phase response over a range of frequencies. This allows users to understand the system's frequency response characteristics.</div>
  
- **Step Response:** <div align="justify"> The app can generate a step response plot, visualizing the system's output behavior when subjected to a sudden step input.
  
- **Pole-Zero Diagram:** The app displays the pole-zero diagram of the transfer function. This graphical representation provides insights into the system's stability and dynamic characteristics.</div>
  
- **Interactive Control:** <div align="justify"> A slider within the app allows users to modify the values of key parameters like natural frequency (wn), decay constant (ζ), and gain (K). This enables real-time exploration of how these parameters influence the system's response as reflected in the Bode plot, step response, and pole-zero diagram.</div>
  
## What is it used for 

<div align="justify"> Essentially, this app serves as an interactive tool for control system engineers and students to gain a deeper understanding of how transfer function parameters affect a system's response. By visualizing the Bode plot, step response, and pole-zero diagram, users can make informed decisions about system design and optimization. </div>
